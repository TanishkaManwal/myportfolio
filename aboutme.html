        <h1>Lets know about me</h1>
        <p>Hi! Iâ€™m a passionate developer, storyteller, and dreamer currently studying at IGDTUW. Iâ€™m deeply curious about how technology and creativity intersect â€” whether it's through building 2D games, experimenting with AI, or crafting emotionally resonant stories. What drives me is the thrill of learning something new and turning ideas into experiences that move people.
            I've completed programs like the GDSC Mobile Development Journey, Googleâ€™s Generative AI course, and Coding Ninjasâ€™ DSA track. Right now, Iâ€™m exploring how to blend storytelling with tech â€” be it through interactive fiction, character-driven narratives, or future-ready AI applications.
            Also? I'm a moon-obsessed night owl who codes in the dark, names characters with hidden meanings, and dances in the rain â€” metaphorically and literally ðŸŒ™âœ¨
